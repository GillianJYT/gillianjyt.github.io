        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Being stuck at home during COVID-19, Discord became my place to hang out and chat with friends. One of our activities was finding random Discord bots 
            and playing with their various commands; some were Pokemon themed, some had card games, and others were linked to video games. I wanted to create  
            my own and add in fun commands for my friends to try out.
        </p>

        <h2>My Contribution and Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
            I used Java to create this bot and the online documentation that Discord published. I started off creating a command that sent a message—the simplest command. 
            Then I made some that interacted with users in voice call. Finally, I tried linking my bot with a video game that we played, so that we can see our statistics 
            and get some cool facts about the game. Unfortunately, I was unable to gain access to the game's data, but I learned a lot about how to create and deploy a bot.
        </p>

        <h2>Possibilities of Further Development</h2>
        <p>
            The basic foundation of the bot is already completed, so further development would be adding more commands or improving existing commands. Alternatively, 
            for my personal growth in software development, I could attempt creating a new Discord bot in another language.
