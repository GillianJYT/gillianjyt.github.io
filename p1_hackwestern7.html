        <h1>Hack Western 7 (2020)</h1>
        <p>
            You're talking a long walk and feel like sitting down. Where's the nearest bench? Or you finish your coffee, but don't see a disposal bin nearby. What do you do?
        </p>

        <h2>Bench Spot App</h2>
        <p>
            The app was created to show the nearest bench or garbage bin to your current location.
            It uses Toronto's public data and Google Maps API to provide this service.
        </p>

        <h2>My Contribution</h2>
        <p>
            I worked on the front-end of the appliation. This involved working in Android Studio, and designing and assessing UX.
        </p>

        <h2>Other Applications</h2>
        <p>
            Given alternate data, this app could be converted to show the nearest of any type of object.
            For example, it could show the nearest restroom for travellers, or the nearest dog park for someone who just moved in.
