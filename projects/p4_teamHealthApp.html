        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This app was the term project for the course MSCI 342: Principles of Software Engineering. We worked as a group of 6 for 4 months.
            The app is developed using Ruby on Rails. Throughout the 4 months, proper SDLC and Agile methodology was followed: interviewed and assessed client needs,
            divided our project into sprints, held weekly stand-ups, followed Git best practices, conducted testing, and delivered our product to the client.
        </p>

        <h2>My Contribution and Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
            Each sprint, there were tasks or features to complete. I added features to the app, made stylistic UX changes, and fixed bugs. Nearing the end of the project,
            I conducted testing and documented found bugs, and did bug fixes for those found by others. Throughout the whole project, I also helped team members in need.
            For example, helping them understand errors in the terminal or providing suggestions on how to implement a feature.
        </p>

        <h2>Possibilities of Further Development</h2>
        <p>
            This app was delivered to the client who was pleased with the app and its functionalities.
            <br><br>
            If given more time for development, I would love to implement features that we missed out on. We had some 'nice-to-have' and 'impossible' features that weren't 
            considered for development given the time constraint or our lack of skills at the time.
        </p>
